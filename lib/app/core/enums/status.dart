/// Represents a type-safe state management mechanism for handling data loading states.
///
/// The [Status] class is a sealed generic class that provides a robust way to
/// manage the lifecycle of data loading across different states. It supports
/// type-safe state transitions and preserves data integrity throughout the process.
///
/// States:
/// - [Initial]: Represents the starting state before any data loading begins.
/// - [Loading]: Indicates an ongoing data retrieval or processing operation.
/// - [Success]: Represents successful data retrieval or processing.
/// - [Failure]: Represents a state where an error occurred during data handling.
///
/// Key Features:
/// - Immutable state representation
/// - Type-safe state transitions
/// - Data preservation across state changes
/// - Flexible error handling
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// VoidStatus status = Initial();
/// status = status.toLoading(); // Transitions to Loading state
/// status = status.toSuccess(data); // Transitions to Success state
/// status = status.toFailure(exception); // Transitions to Failure state
/// ```

  /// Handles state transitions from [Initial], [Success], and [Failure] states.
  /// Preserves existing data during the transition:
  /// - For [Initial] state, keeps initial data
  /// - For [Success] state, keeps current data
  /// - For [Failure] state, keeps previous data
  ///
  /// Returns a new [Loading] state with optional current data.
